Write the queries listed below using the database you created in part 1. Use comments to number your queries. Use single quotes for string values. If you need help remembering how to do some of these queries, please check out the videos at the bottom of this page under "Helpful Resources." You can do this!

Query 2: Student's age in years and days as of Mar. 10, 2019.  Sorted from oldest to youngest. Duplicates are not allowed.  (You can assume a 365 day year and ignore leap day.)
